# Pyformat

Providing code formatting and import sorting for python codes using `autopep8` and `isort`.

Pyformat will read your "python.pythonPath" configuration to choose correct python environment.

If you don't have autopep8 and isort installed, Pyformat will ask and call `pip` to install them for you.

## Why
There's some reason that I can't use the official [vscode-python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), so I created this extension for myself.
